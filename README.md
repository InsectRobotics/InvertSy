This Python package implements environments such as the *sky* and an *AntWorld of
vegetation*, using  simple-to-install python packages, e.g. NumPy and SciPy. These
environments contain information that humans can or cannot detect but invertebrates
definitely can (e.g. polarised light in the sky). This package also contains some
examples of how to use the [InvertPy](https://github.com/InsectRobotics/InvertPy) package.
